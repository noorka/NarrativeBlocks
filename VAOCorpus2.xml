               <p>THE renowned Pepin, king of France, had a sister named Bellisant, who was exceedingly beautiful, and whose hand was demanded in
                  marriage by several kings and princes. <!-- BLOCK powerful marriage -->The lady Bellisant's choice fell on Alexander, emperor of
                  Constantinople, who came to the court of king Pepin to espouse the princess. Great rejoicings were made on the occasion throughout
                  France; and shortly after the marriage, the emperor took leave of king Pepin, and conducted his lovely bride with great pomp and
                  triumph to the city of Constantinople.</p>
               <p><!-- BLOCK advisor suggests infidelity -->The emperor's prime minister and greatest favorite was an arch priest, a selfish and cruel
                  man, who completely governed the emperor, and tyrannized over his subjects. The arch priest observing the gentleness and sweetness
                  of the new empress, began to fear that she would acquire too much influence over the emperor, and wickedly resolved to seek the
                  destruction of the innocent lady. The emperor was of a credulous and suspicious temper, and the arch priest soon <pb n="4"

                  entered the apartment and, prostrating himself at the emperor's feet, said, <said>"High and mighty king, may heaven guard your
                     majesty from the base attempts of the wicked and treacherous! I am a holy priest and may not seek the death of any man; nor may I
                     reveal the name of the criminal who has intrusted to me, in the way of confession, a dreadful secret; but, in the most solemn
                     manner, I conjure your majesty to beware of the designs of your empress; for that beautiful and dissembling lady in faithless and
                     disloyal, and even now is planning your death. O mighty emperor! my heart swells with indignation, to think that a lady so
                     unparalleled in beauty and wisdom, and the sister of a great king, should become so dishonorable and wicked."</said></p>
               <p><!-- BLOCK accusation of infidelity-->The emperor, giving implicit faith to the arch priest's tale, could no longer restrain his
                  fury; and abruptly leaving the arch priest, he rushed into the apartment of the empress, and in the most fierce, rude, and unmanly
                  manner, dragged the fair Bellisant about the chamber by her long and beautiful hair.</p>
               <p><said>"Alas! my dear lord,"</said> she cried, <said>"what moves you to this outrage?"</said></p>

                  dashing her with violence against the ground, he left her speechless.</p>
               <p>The attendants of the empress finding her bleeding and senseless upon the floor, uttered loud screams, which presently brought all
                  the nobles of the court into the chamber of the empress. Every one pitied the sufferings of their amiable queen; and the state
                  councellors demanded an audience of the emperor, to represent to him the wrongs he had done to an honorable lady, in whom no one had
                  ever percieved a fault. But the emperor was mad with passion, which the arch priest continued artfully to inflame, and to the
                  reprehensions of his state councellors, he answered, <said>"Let no man presume to defend her who has basely betrayed me. She shall
                     die; and they who interfere in her behalf shall partake the dreadful punishment that awaits this wretched and disloyal
                     woman."</said></p>
               <p>The empress being recovered from her swoon, then fell on her knees, and, with tears, thus addressed the emperor:</p>
               <p><said>"Alas! my lord, take pity on one who never harbored an evil thought against your person or dignity. I shall soon become a

               <p>The hard-hearted emperor, bewitched with the false tales of the insidious priest, answered, <said>"Perish thou and thy child, basest
                     of women! Thy child will be to me no joy, but rather great dishonor."</said></p>
               <p>The courtiers, preceiving nothing could mitigate the rage of the emperor, removed Bellisant from his presence. Her faithful servant
                  Blandiman, now threw himself at her feet, exclaiming, <said>"Ah! madam, quit this barbarous monarch, and suffer me to conduct you to

                     a shameful death."</said></p>
               <p><said>"No, Blandiman,"</said> the queen replied, <said>"I must not follow thy advice: should I steal privately from the court, it
                     might be said I had fled knowing myself to be guilty. Believe me, I had rather die the most cruel death, than bear the blame of
                     that of which I am innocent."</said></p>
               <p><!-- BLOCK banishment of the innocent -->The emperor still loving his queen, could not bring himself to pronounce the sentence of
                  her execution; yet as the base arch priest continually irritated his mind with false accusations against her, he resolved to banish
                  her from his dominions, and immediately commanded her to quit Constantinople. At the same time he published an edict forbidding all
                  persons on pain of death, to assist or succour the unfortunate lady, allowing her no other attendant than her servant Blandiman,
                  whom she had brought with her from France.</p>
               <p>Sentence being thus pronounced, the queen and Blandiman hastened away. As she passed through the city, she was met by multitudes of
                  people, lamenting the loss of so good an empress. When she had left Constantinople, <said>"Alas!"</said> cried she, <said>"in what

                     shouldest thou do with such a woful sister?"</said> As she was thus complaining and weeping with anghish, her servant said to
                  her, <said>"Alas, madam, be not discomforted, but trust in Providence, who will keep and defend you!"</said> Having thus spoken, he
                  espied a fountain, towards which he and his lady took their way.</p>

               <p>Orson stood for a few moments motionless with alarm and amazement: then supposing his ancient friend might be only asleep, he
                  stooped and endeavoured to rouse her; but finding all his efforts ineffectual, his grief is scarcely to be described. He threw
                  himself upon the body, and uttered piercing shrieks of distress. At length he suddenly sprang up from the ground, and, approaching
                  Valentine, made signs that he would now be his; and while the tears ran down his cheeks for the loss of his bear, he suffered
                  Valentine to bind his hands, and unresistingly followed his conductor.</p>
               <p>Valentine took his way towards Orleans; but wherever he passed, the people, perceiving the wild man, ran into their houses and hid
                  themselves. On arriving at an inn where Valentine intended resting during the night, the terrified inhabitants fastened the doors,
                  and would not suffer them to enter. Valentine made signs <pb n="21"

                  provisions roasting at the fire. Orson tore the meat off the spit with his hands, and devoured it greedily: and espying a caldron of
                  water, he put his head into it and drank like a horse.</p>

                  Valentine made signs to Orson, who tearing up one of the large stone posts that stood by, shattered the gate to pieces.</p>
               <p>The queen, the princess Eglantine, and all their attendants, fled to hide themselves, when they heard that Orson was arrived; and
                  Valentine had the greatest difficulty to persuade them to believe that Orson was no longer furious and savage as he had been in the
                  woods. At length the king permitted him to be brought in: and the whole court soon gathered in a crowd in the apartment, and were
                  much amused by his wild actions and gestures, although very cautious not to come near to him. On Valentine's making signs, he kissed
                  the king's robe, and the hand of the princess Eglantine: for Orson had now become so attached to Valentine that he would obey him in
                  all things, but would suffer no other person to attempt to control him. If Valentine went for a moment out of his sight, he would
                  utter cries of distress, and overturn every one that stood in the way, while he ran about the palace in search of him. And he slept
                  at night in Valentine's chamber upon the floor; for he could not be prevailed on to lie on a bed.</p>

               <p><!-- BLOCK Knight and squire rescue princess -->Very soon after the capture of Orson, a herald appeared at the court of king Pepin,
                  from the duke of Aquitain, summoned all true knights to avenge the cause of the lady Fezon, daughter to the noble duke, who was held
                  in cruel captivity by Agramont, the green knight: the herald proclaiming, that whoever should conquer the green knight should
                  recieve the hand of the lady Fezon in marriage, together with a princely drowry.</p>
               <p>This green knight was so famous for his cruelty and his victories, that the young lords of the court all drew back and seemed
                  unwilling to enter the lists; for it was known that he was defended by enchantments, and that it was his practice to hang upon a
                  tree all the knights whom he had defeated. Valentine, however, offered himself without hesitation, and engaged to get ready and
                  depart the next morning.</p>
               <p>The princess Eglantine secretly resolved, if possible, to prevent the destruction of her beloved Valentine, by combating the green
                  knight herself. She had been accustomed to fence and ride, and was greatly accomplished in all the manly exercises. She contrived to
                  steal away the armour of Valentine while he slept, and equipping herself in it, mounted a fiery courser; and, attended only by her

               <p>Valentine mean while missing his armour when he arose at the dawn of day, and learning that the princess had taken it and was gone
                  on this perilous enterprise, was almost distracted with his terrors for her safety. He ordered his horse to be prepared; and,
                  followed by Orson, set out in search of the princess.</p>
               <p>Haufray and Henry, disappointed in their former purpose, now resolved to waylay and kill Valentine. Accordingly, in a narrow alley
                  of a dark wood, they sprang upon him and seized him before he had power to draw his sword. Orson chanced to be a little way behind;
                  but on hearing Valentine's voice, he rushed upon Henry, who was about to stab Valentine in the back, and seized him in his arms.
                  Orson's grasp almost crushed Henry to death, and Valentine would have killed Haufray; but first tearing the masks from their faces,
                  and seeing they were the king's sons, he left them to the shame and disgrace their base conduct would bring upon them. He had some
                  difficulty to prevail on Orson to let them live; but having prevailed, they left the wicked brothers in the wood, and continued

                  but on a slender branch. Valentine, breathless with his exertions to pull down the shield, stood leaning against the tree, when
                  Agramont, with a loud laugh exclaimed, <said>"Fly and save thyself, fair knight; for, since thou canst not move the shield, thou art
                     not destined to be my victor. Further, know, there is no one living who can subdue me, except he be the son of a mighty king, and

                  time employed in gazing with looks of delight and admiration on the beautiful lady Fezon.
                  <!-- BLOCK squire saves the princess -->Valentine led him to the enchanted shield; which on Orson's raising his arm towards it,
                  dropped instantly from its place. A loud blast of wind now rushed through the trees, the ground rocked beneath their feet, and the
                  green knight trembled and turned pale; then gnashing his teeth, he seized his sword, and attacked Orson with desperate fury. At the

                  he had been a mere child, dashed on the ground, and would have instantly destroyed him, had not Valentine interposed to save his
                  life. Orson continued to hold him down till some chains were brought; when, in despite of the furious struggles of the green knight,
                  Orson bound him in fetters to lead him away a prisoner.</p>
               <p>Argamont, finding himself entirely subdued, addressed himself to Valentine, and said, <said>"This savage man is my conqueror;

                  princes. Her choice fell on Alexander, Emperor of Constantinople, who came to the court of King Pepin to espouse her, and then
                  escort her home in state as his bride.</p>
               <p><!-- BLOCK advisor suggests infidelity-->Alexander's Prime minister, and a favorite, was a shelfish and cruel arch-priest, who,
                  fearing the lovely empress would soon usurp his influence over the emperor, resolved to effect her destruction.</p>
               <p><!-- BLOCK advisor suggests infidelity -->The emperor, being of a suspicious disposition, the arch-priest worked upon it for some
                  time, at first; and then one day, when the emperor was alone, he entered his apartments, and said,— <said>"Mighty king, may heaven
                     guard your majesty from the treacherous designs of your empress: who, not content with faithlessness to your sacred person, now
                     seeks to destroy even your life,"</said></p>

                  his wife's apartment, he in a savage manner, dragged her about by the hair, exclaiming, <said>"Base wretch! I am but too well
                     informed of your infamous proceedings!"</said> Then dashing her on the ground, he left her, desiring her to prepare herself for
                  death.</p>
               <p>The empress having by the help of her attendants, somewhat recovered, sought the emperor, and falling on her knees thus addressed
                     him,—<said>"Oh take pity on one who has ever faithfully loved you! I shall soon become a mother; and I implore your compassion on
                     behalf of my child! let me be imprisoned until its birth; and then, if your anger be not appeased, do with me as you please; but,

                  conduct her to her brother's court, but she refused, as that would imply a confession of guilt.</p>
               <p><!-- BLOCK banishment of the innocent -->The emperor banished his queen, instead of putting her to death, but forbade all persons,
                  except her faithful attendant, Blandiman, to assist her, on pain of death. Thus accompanied, she soon reached the forest of Orleans,
                  when overcome with fatigue, she sank on a couch made up of withered leaves and moss, prepared by her devoted servant, who then

                  the other infant laid, was surprised to see the litle beauty, who held out his tiny arms, as if to ask for protection. <said>"See,
                     my lords,"</said> said King Pepin, <said>"this lovely infant appears to solicit my favour; I will adopt it as my own."</said> He
                  then delivered the babe to one of the pages, who took it to a nurse, and by the royal command, it recieved the name of
                  Valentine.</p>
               <p><!-- BLOCK innocent rebuked by sibling -->Scarcely had the page galloped off when the king met Blandiman, and demanded what news
                  from Constantinople, when hearing that the arch-priest had accused his royal sister of plotting the emperor's death, he declared his
                  belief in its truth, and blamed the emperor for sparing her life, adding, <said>"Let her beware how she comes into my
                  power."</said></p>
               <p>Blandiman now sought his mistress, whom he found half distracted with her accumulated miseries. She related to him the birth and
                  dreadful loss of her infant, and learning her brother's unjust wrath against her, resolved to take shelter in a monastery.</p>

                  cubs, however, instead of devouring it, fondled it which the old one percieving, gave it suck and the child grew strong and hearty.
                  As he increased in size and strength, he ranged the forest attacking the wild beast with such fury, that they dare not approach the

                  bear.</p>
               <p>Valentine, meanwhile, had been brought up with the king's daughter, Eglantine, to whom he was passionately attached. He was highly

                  thousand marks of gold to whoever should bring Orson, dead or alive, on which Henry told his royal sire, that he thought no one so
                  qualified to undertake this hazardous enterprise as the foundling Valentine, adding, <said>"and perhaps, if he conquers the savage,
                     you will reward him with the hand of our sister, Eglantine."</said> The king, seeing their envy, frowned displeasure; but
                  Valentine, hinting that the advice was given in the hope of encompassing his death, declared that it concerned his honor, and he
                  would brave the danger willingly, to preserve it unsullied.</p>

                  <p>So Pacolet led them to the gates of the caſtle, and having prepared a ſhip he conveyed them to Lady Fazon, at the City of
                     Acquitain; next morning when Feragus heard of their eſcape, he was enraged to the laſt degree. The Knights and Ladies being out

                     Orſon with great ſolemnity; upon which tilts and tournaments were performed for many days; but Valentine carried the prize by
                     overthrowing at leaſt above an hundred brave Knights.</p>

                     wife Clerimond; and <!-- BLOCK Squire ascends to power -->giving the government of the Empire unto his brother, he departed, to
                     the great ſorrow of all, particular his mother Belliſant, and the fair Clerimond.</p>
                  <p><!-- BLOCK Knight returns home -->Valentine, after ſeven years absence returned, dreſſed like a poor palmer, begging victuals at
                     the gate of his own palace; and at length being ſick and about to die, he called for Clerimond and made himſelf known to her, at
                     which ſhe was ready to give up the ghoſt.</p>
                  <p><!-- BLOCK Knight dies -->At laſt having recommended the care of her to his brother, and the Empreſs, his dear mother, and
                     bleſſing of them, he turned on one ſide, and breathed out his noble ſoul from his illuſtrious body, to the great grief of all the

                     of human affairs, <!-- BLOCK Ally ascends to power -->he gave the charge of his Empire, Wife, and Children, to the Green Knight,
                     <!-- BLOCK Squire becomes a hermit -->and then turning Hermit, he became reſident of the foreſts and woods, where,
